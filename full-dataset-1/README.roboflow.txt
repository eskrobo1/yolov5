The dataset includes 12688 images.
Drone-boxes-drinks-xFg5 are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 3 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.5 percent of pixels
